	1.9 => 2.0	(?.?.88)

## Lots of variable renaming.  The one essential change (gnews-hook-list
## => hook-kill-all) is updated automatically just by running Gnews.  If
## you do nothing, the only harm will be ignored customizations, including
## some of the less common hook-kills.  To adapt, run `M-x gnews-rename'
## (in Help.el) while visiting the following: your .emacs and other such
## initialization files you use, and also your .gnewsrc.hook.

## M-x gnews has been bound to giving you the detailed version of the
## above automatically.   M-x Gnews is, for now, the true entry point
## to running Gnews.

The seventh draft of the texinfo manual is ready.  Internal docs cleaned
up some more.

article+/-1 rewritten: entering big newsgroups with mostly unread news
should be much quicker.

index-kill (k) and index-kill-permanent (K) implemented.

index-auto (the list of regexps for automatic indexing) eliminated.
Instead, use a pre-hook of the form (pre nil index-if).  And the
corresponding hook-kill-insert-index (^C^I) command was added to
Hook Kill mode.  See docs for more details and features.

New user variables: group-save-junk and group-pipe-junk non-nil mean
junk after "s,o,^O" and "|" respectively.  nntp-exec-verbose means
run the NNTP internals in verbose mode.  nntp-exec-log-p means keep
a log of NNTP commands (and returned information strings) in the
variable nntp-exec-log.  reply-path, if a string, means use it as
an explicit "Path:" header when posting, and if nil, things are as
before.

gnews-edit-rot13 (^C^R) (rot13 a region) added to Gnews Edit mode.

reply-indent (^C^I) sets the region after indenting.

reply-to-simplify (^C^T) rewritten and documented.  See doc string for
the variable path-data-file for details.  See manual Section 5.7, Info
node "mail headers" for full details.

reply-newsgroup (^C^N) (for entering newsgroup names quickly) added.

{news,group}-catchup (c), gnews: arguments changed to "P\np" order.

More Group mode commands take explicit number prefixes: group-catchup
(c) and the four reply commands (r,R,f,F).  In the catchup case, it
means catch up all but that many articles.  In the reply cases, it's
merely the same as a prefix argument.

hook-kill-insert-{pre,junk,junk-local} (^C^P,^C^J,^C^L) will now take
null headers.  [Formerly gnews-hook-insert-{pre,junk,junk-local}: see
comment above about renaming.]

article-digest-restart (<) added.

("." "." setq hook-kill-continue nil) in hook-kills can be replaced
with the more intuitive ("." "." article-yes): this means set to the
article immediately, breaking out of hook-kill processing.  The Hook
Kill mode command hook-kill-insert-yes (^C^Y) inserts one of these.

gnews-legalese-{license,copying,no-warranty} (~LL,~LC,~LW) added.

File save defaults have a further option.  See gnews-save-name docs.

The way to set up Digest mode hooks for mixed digest/article newsgroups
has been simplified immensely:
	(pre nil article-digest-if "TeXhax@Score" t)
is now all that is needed in comp.text to dedigestify TeXhax digests.
See docs for article-digest-if.

hook-kill-insert-digest (^C^D) improved to handle both kinds of digest
hooks automatically.  With a prefix argument, it handles rot13-ed digests.

Rot13-ing improved:
 (1) Autorot13ing is now supported in per-hooks.  For example,
		("Keywords" "rot13" setq gnews-rot13-p t)
     will work as you might think.
 (2) Rot13-ed digests are readable in a transparent manner by hooks
     similar to the non-rot13-ed versions, with an extra "t" argument
     in position 3 (for both article-digest and article-digest-if).

Bug in reply-to-simplify (^C^T) fixed.  Bug in group-previous-unread (p)
when at the index for the first item in the newsgroup fixed.  Dumbo bug
in fast Spool indexing that made it impossible fixed.  An obscure bug in
group-mark-permanent (~M) fixed.  Bug where new Gnewsers who don't read
any articles can't quit fixed.  A (totally unrelated) bug whereby any
hand-edited changes in a .gnewsrc get wiped out if you then run Gnews
without reading any articles fixed.  A (sit-for 2) debugging statement
left inside reply-yank-fill (^C^Q) removed.  article-digest-previous (p)
bug in not resetting the %-age fixed.  article-down (d) and article-line
(LFD,RET) now work with digests.  Null signatures don't add "-- ".
group-next-same-subject (~N) catches not-found articles.

	1.8 => 1.9	(8.8.88)

The third draft of the texinfo manual is ready.

gnews-describe-mode (H or ^C^H) with a prefix argument goes directly to
the appropriate Info node.

More digest mode: replies, followups and saves work.  If you wish to
submit posted articles by mail, then setq n-reply-digest-mail to t,
meaning derive an address from the digest's "From:", or set it to a
string, meaning use that string as the address.

article-not-found-hooks added to permit non-standard article retrieval.
See docs for article-run-hooks.

reply-yank-fill (^C^Q) rewritten--it is now much better at identifying
indentation prefixes and paragraph breaks.

Window-configuration code used when leaving Gnews or an index.  Gnews
now returns to where you were when you last ran M-x gnews, not where
you were when you first ran M-x gnews.

Buffer popping/switching systemized: index-pop-up and gnews-hook-pop
switch to the buffer when nil, pop when non-nil, and pop and resize
the window to the indicated size when the variable is a number.  The
variable index-window-height is now unsupported.  In general, you can
rewrite the gnews-buffer function, now isolated.

group-supersedes (S) renamed group-supersede; ditto for the hook.

gnews-output-to-mbox-file (^O) added to group-mode.

gnews-hook-mode rewritten.  Instead of ^C^O to create a generic hook-kill,
there are six distinct ^C-bound keys for the standard ones, (like ^C^D
for (pre nil article-digest)), and one apiece (^C^O,^C^P,^C^Q) for the
generic pre/per/post-hooks respectively.

reply-signature-point replaced with reply-signature-marker.

Emacs keyboard macros work with Gnews now.  (!?)

index and reply code no longer autoloaded, as this can break kill-hooks.

Recentering improved.

An article-history list is now maintained.  group-last-seen (-) rewritten
to use it.  Suggestions?

"Truncated articles" that are really a side effect of bad news software
wrongly counting the blank line between the header and article text are
now handled somewhat better.  No message or beep--just hit space twice.

New new newsgroup group adder replaced.

The followings bugs have been fixed:  Digest code hanging if last article
contained a spurious digest separator.  First index article sometimes be-
ing junked.  Erasure of post hooks when running group-index.  Hook-kills
not setting local variables.  Hanging on multiple cancelled articles that
are at the beginning of a just entered newsgroup.  No permanent marking.
Not defaulting to the previous save file name with group-save (s) when
gnews-save-style was t.  Wiping out post-hooks after group-reply-return
(*).  group-get not calling first article interactively.

	1.7 => 1.8	(11.7.88)

New new newsgroup detector put in.  When you get the new newsgroup
message, use news-new (~G) to go into a subscription loop.  Use name
expansion to see the offered groups, and keyboard-quit (^G) to break
the loop early.

gnews-hook-kill-alist added, to allow a group's permanent kills and
editing to refer to a regexp instead of the group name.  This makes it
simple to handle the hook-kills for related newsgroups together.

group-quit-restore added, but not bound.  You can quit a newsgroup and
restore the .gnewsrc to what it was upon entry.

article-header-hook is run upon exit from article-display-init (which
initializes the header and header info) and article-restart-verbose (v).
This permits radical header customization.

article-digest-previous (p) moves back one digest article.

Numerous '(lambda ...)s turned into (function (lambda ...))s.  The nntp-
-index-filter is much less GC piggish.  Index-sort is now faster.

New variable index-ding controls behavior upon completion of indexing.
nil means finish silently.  t means ding the user.  Numeric means ding
if the number of indexed articles is greater than this number.

Spool code simplification: you can throw out the specialized start hook.
In fact, you must.  Simply install Gnews with a nil nntp-service, and
Gnews will do all the necessary scut work for you.  Fast indexing, con-
trolled by news-index-fast, is now available for spool code also, and
is the default.

Bug where $-end pseudo-article (treated internally as one more than the
last article) could sometimes be junked fixed.  Bug where group-first (^)
sometimes got the second article fixed.  Bug in the handling of formfeeds
after a failed article-previous-unread (p) fixed.  Bug in cancel/super-
session with non-empty mail-header-separator fixed.

	1.6 => 1.7 	(30.6.88)

Several speed/GC improvements: news-{next,previous}-unread (n,p) are
faster.  amark internals revamped to use setcar/setcdr/nconc; this
should make for both speed and much less garbage collection.  News-
group checkpointing is also faster and less of a GC hog.  Startup,
unfortunately, is slightly slower.

Due to popular demand, news-restart (R) added.  It restarts all of the
NNTP internals and checkpoints everything in sight.

Formfeeds are now caught.  They do not yet mix with rot13, which is due
for an overhaul anyway.

Put (per nil article-digest) in the hook-kills of digest newsgroups, eg,
comp.risks.  This isn't digest-mode yet, but the improvement is dramatic.
In particular, article-digest-next (n) moves forward one digest article.

The user variable gnews-buffer-clean has been added: non-nil (the default)
means delete, as opposed to bury, Gnews' buffers.  (You could unwittingly
lose an unsent reply this way.  Caveat user.)

group-forward-article unbound, since M-f is and will remain forward-word
by default.  I've changed things so that "C-u r" and "C-u R", that is,
e-reply with a prefix argument, runs group-forward-article.

The cursor is now, by default, always in the minibuffer in news-mode.  It
works for me, but if it messes things up for you, turn it off by setting
news-grab-cursor to nil.

Replies now erase, by default, the *gnews*reply* buffer's contents if the
previous message has been sent.  Unsent messages still need confirmation
before erasing.  See the documentation of reply-query-clear for the details.

The amark-list variable has been renamed amark.

Minor bug in news-last-seen (-) fixed.  Minor bugs where the running dots
froze without a prompt on new newsgroups, and with temporary kill and
permanent KILL side effecting each other fixed.  Serious bug in non-terse
junking with article-get-slow in hook-kills fixed.  Serious bug in gnews-
output-to-rmail-file (o) fixed.

	1.5 => 1.6	(21.6.88)

I fixed the indexing eat-one-character bug.  Talk about trivial hacks!

group-forward-article (~F) added: it sets up a reply for forwarding the
current article by e-mail.					[AR]

article-get-msg-id (@) by default now offers to find the first article
whose message-ID ends after point.				[AR]

User variable article-junk-unsub (default t) added: if nil, junking will
not mark your in-.gnewsrc-but-unsubscribed-to newsgroups.  Usage should
cut down on some garbage collection.				[AR]

gnews-set, gnews-fset, and gnews-key are now interactive.

Bug in group-first (^) fixed.  Minor bug in amark-{loop,pool} fixed.
Very minor bug in news-unsubscribe (u) fixed.

Highlighting added: See if article-subject-hilite non-nil works for you.
It doesn't work in a separate X-window Emacs, nor TVI-920s, nor Apollos.
It does work on a Z-29, VT100, Suns, and a Sun X window with a shell.

Behavior of group-{forward,backward} (N,P) changed: when the index is
around, these now follow the index.  Also, they now take (positive)
numeric arguments, which do the obvious thing.

article-edit (W) added, allowing for in-line editing of article displays.
I can't get the "edited" keyword to show up though.

news-index (=) doesn't waste time stepping by 1 through the large gaps
between the first few existing articles.

caar, cadr, etc all changed to gnaar, gnadr, etc.  gnews-caar dropped.  I
(and others) were running into too many problems trying to use code that
had these as functions.  (Emacs libraries have generally been inconsistent
about this, btw.)

Help.el and index.el are now autoloaded, like reply.el.

New newsgroup checking is now back to square 1: "newgroups" was removed
from NNTP 1.5.  Sigh.  What a pain.

nntp-version added.  (This will matter: NNTP 1.5 has XHDR.)

	1.4 => 1.5	(3.6.88)

Gnews source has been split into fifteen files: {Help,Init,NNTP,Roster,
Spool,art,entry,group,hook,index,mail,news,prims,reply,utils}.el.  The
primary entry point is now Init.el.  All site-specific initialization
is at the top of Init.el.  Only Init.el needs to be re-byte-compiled
to run Gnews fresh off of the ftp, and not even that if users set the
site-specific variables themselves.  If you re-byte-compile the other
*.el files, be sure to load prims.el first.  [Of course, if you have
funny problems inside NNTP.el, say with Apollos, you still have to deal
with that separately.]

If gnews-caar is bound, caar, cadr, etc will be loaded from the value of
gnews-caar.							[obsolete]

index-article-get (=) added to index-mode.  It pops or switches, based on
what your preference is, as indicated by the current value of index-pop
(which by default is set to index-pop-up).  In other words, you should be
able to "=====" your way back and forth between articles and an index,
instead of "=o=o=" or "=f=f=".

index-auto is a list of regexps matching those newsgroups to always index
upon news-yes (y) group entry.					[AR]

reply-yank (^c^y) was cleaned up a bit.

Replies now start [and still end] life unmodified, as in mail-mode.

The spool code "debugged"; some rewrites to accomodate it.	[HRP]

Obscure bugs in article-get-{slow,msg-id} fixed.

Erroneous post-Gnews return buffer bug fixed, mostly, sort of.

news-next-unread (n) wraps to the beginning at the $-end pseudo-newsgroup;
news-{first,next,previous}-* internals separated out as news-next-intern.
Most news-* functions now ding when invoked at the $-end.

Newsgroup restrictions, as set by news-only-match (o) and news-add-match (a),
are now in effect with news-next-unread (n) and related motion commands.

index-search-{forward,backward} (s,r) have been rebound to (/,?), so that
in the future `s' will be bound to index-save.

	1.3 => 1.4	(28.3.88)

The gnews-spool-machine defvar was moved to the top of gnewsutils.el.
This is for the benefit of those having great difficulty getting Gnews
to load/compile.

Use of the kill-ring eliminated from all(?) Gnews internals.

The badly erroneous 1.3 hook-kill junking bug is fixed.

The old, annoying can't-easily-enter-long-unread-newsgroups bug is fixed.

Bugs in group-last-seen (-), group-mark-later (M), {group,index}-catchup
(c), group-next-same-subject (~N), group-first (^), fixed.

Warnings are not made when the error is only 1.

gnews-output-to-rmail-file now saves full headers and a summary line.
You will probably want to modify your rmail-ignored-headers variable to
further ignore any ugly news headers like Path, Distribution, etc.

Several amark-* primitives have become macros.  This should speed a few
things up.

The extra mail headers set by mail-self-blind, mail-archive-file-name,
and mail-default-reply-to, are now set in e-reply buffers.

DEL added as a binding for {group,pager}-mode's group-back (b), so that
paging forward/backward through articles and indices are both more like
view-mode.

index-ignore (i) added for quick skipping over of topics.  So for large
newsgroups, sorting the index-buffer and "i"gnoring, along with a final
catchup, should be a quick way to pass through everything.

index-undo (U) now not only sets the index-buffer window contents back,
but also resets the amark-list to correspond to the new display.  Cross-
posted junks are not undone, however.

X/Mouse binding removed from index-mode-map.  index-x-select still exists.

	1.2 => 1.3	(24.3.88)

per-hooks are faster and leaner now.

gnews-bug-report (^w) added to {news,group,index}-mode.

A news-next-unread-maybe internal was introduced, so that group quitting
tries to be smart about quitting and sitting versus quitting and seeking.
Change that function if you want different behavior.

Articles with missing Line fields are now counted correctly.  A tweak to
handle the Penn State bozo Lines field is in gnews-weemba (W)--it some-
times displays the wrong percentage on initial display, but it works.

group-follow-yank (F) prompts for a file-name at the $-end of a newsgroup.

news-default ( ) is set to news-next-unread (n) upon startup with a prefix.

An NNTPSERVER environmental variable is recognized.

{e,n}-reply-toggle (^c-) go back and forth between posting/mailing.  If
you use my customization 'article-to-3, note that it had to change.

group-catchup (c) with a zero argument catches up to current article.
You have to type ^u0c, not 0c, unfortunately.  Later.

Mode hooks are run before displaying the mode-string.  The group-mode
default now shows the article number if possible.

On a trace-back article, the group motion keys, like group-next-unread (n),
return you to the originating article in the trace back.

gnews-fset added, for use within pre-hooks.

	1.1 => 1.2	(22.2.88)

On initial no-connect, return to previous buffer.

New variable group-all-headers: non-nil means show all the headers.
This is intended for the *.test and control newsgroups.

Bugs in group-mark (m), index-mark (m) fixed.

gnews-hook-post is always(?) run now when leaving a newsgroup.

Unsubscribe and catchup code invoke the corresponding roster-* for the
internal work.

reply->-replace (^C>) and reply->-count (^C%) have been added to
n-reply-mode.  The first has also been added to e-reply-mode.

group-digit (0-9) is now used to pass both amarks and numeric prefixes to
commands.  Before it only passed amarks.  The 'group-range-prefix property
is used to identify which to pass.  Thus, "3t" will trace back 3 articles.

	1.0 => 1.1	(20.2.88)

The user variable article-big is used to indicate big articles.  So far
this means that articles this size and larger use article-init-display
as if it were effectively nil.  (nil is its default anyway)

Bugs in group-cancel (C), article-rot13 (X), article-rot13-restart (~^X),
news-previous (P), group-next-same-subject (~N), group-supersedes (S),
and news-move (M) fixed.

Bug whereby Gnews hung on servers that did not return trailing ^M's fixed.

Most of group-mode is now blocked when at the $-pseudo-article.

group-trace (t) will take a 0 prefix argument: this means go to the first
referenced article.

False reset warnings on keyboard-quit (^G) have been eliminated.

Newsgroup article counts should always be correct now.

Bogus newsgroups are now indicated as such and blocked from entry.
