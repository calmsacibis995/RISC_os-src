    Should searching (/,?,~N,~P) grab 10-20 headers at a time?

    Newsgroups' nntp-info's should be computed 10-20 newsgroups at a time.

    similar hook-kill's handled en masse

    Use window-configuration code
 
    same-subject needs to be rewritten (via lists of related articles?)

    cache up headers

    improved .gnewsrc checkpointing--does this include GC!?

    Catch failed postings.

    article-save and article-pipe need to be loopable.

    Article-saving/piping should have header control via a hook.

    Integrate mail with an mbox.* news hierarchy?

    saving large indices--via autosave?  (put info in a buffer?)

    posting directly from news-mode

    index-buffer backward expansion commands.  The logic needs thought.

    group-hook-edit should be able to modify gnews-hook-{per,post?} directly.

    (## REGEXP article-junk) means junk if REGEXP is in first ## lines.

    Perhaps spaf shaddai will provide computable Message-ID's for *.newusers.

    If default signaturing is nil, then fake a display of what inews will do.

    Create an indexing cache on group entry--always?

    improved hyphenation/refilling in reply modes

    More than just (string-match regexp group) to trigger hooks on group
	
    newsgroup checking (ie, the rn "-c" flag)

    locking of the .gnewsrc file

    Provide backup versions of .hook (and .time?) files.

[ ] clean mechanisms/hooks for variants on one-NNTP-server news reading

[ ] reply-spell

[ ] faster article deletion and more precomputation

[ ] roster-mode

[ ] If new groups arrive but news-new isn't invoked, save the new group list.

[ ] An article history-mode?

[ ] Articles should be buffered/nntp-exec backgrounded.

[ ] digest-mode

[*] an infotex manual

[*] Minimize garbage.

[*] Avoid running redundant nntp-exec's.

[*] Provide internals to run off a news spool directory directly.

[*] Get rid of the (nntp-exec t t "help") inside roster-new-update.

[*] catch formfeeds

[*] highlighting of subject lines

[*] block meaningless commands when at the $-end of a newsgroup

[*] Eliminate all internal uses of the kill-ring.

[*] Background the index prep by send-stringing all the HEAD requests at once

[*] group-digit should be usable to set standard prefix-arguments.

[*] Better amark-list cleaning; article+/-1 should close up dead space.

[*] The amark-* functions must be de-recursed

[*] C code => (open-network-stream ...)

[*] Block the running of pre-hooks until post-hooks have been run.

[*] article header regexp searching already

[*] Include a mailbox/folder option for article-save.

[*] Slashify newsgroup names in save files
