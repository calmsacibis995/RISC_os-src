  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior Dbx process.

The following commands are available:
\\{inferior-dbx-mode-map}

Entry to this mode calls the value of dbx-mode-hook with no arguments,
if that value is non-nil.  Likewise with the value of shell-mode-hook.
dbx-mode-hook is called after shell-mode-hook.

You can display the debugging program in other window and point out
where you are looking at using the command \\[dbx-where].

\\[dbx-trace-mode] toggles dbx-trace mode. In dbx-trace mode,
debugging program is automatically traced using output from dbx.

The command \\[dbx-stop-at] sets break point at current line of the
program in the buffer. Major mode name of the buffer must be in
dbx-language-mode-list.

Commands:

Return at end of buffer sends line as input.
Return not at end copies rest of line to end and sends it.
\\[shell-send-eof] sends end-of-file as input.
\\[kill-shell-input] and \\[backward-kill-word] are kill commands, imitating normal Unix input editing.
\\[interrupt-shell-subjob] interrupts the shell or its current subjob if any.
\\[stop-shell-subjob] stops, likewise. \\[quit-shell-subjob] sends quit signal, likewise.
\\[dbx-where] displays debugging program in other window and
 points out where you are looking at.
\\[dbx-trace-mode] toggles dbx-trace mode.
\\[dbx-stop-at] sets break point at current line."
