;;; autoinsert.el

;;;  Abstract:
;;;
;;;  The following defines an association list for files to be
;;;  automatically inserted when a new file is created, and a function
;;;  which automatically inserts these files; the idea is to insert
;;;  default files much as the mode is automatically set using
;;;  auto-mode-alist.
;;;
;;;  The auto-insert-alist consists of dotted pairs of
;;;  ( REGEXP . FILENAME ) where REGEXP is a regular expression, and
;;;  FILENAME is the file name of a file which is to be inserted into
;;;  all new files matching the regular expression with which it is
;;;  paired.
;;;
;;;  To use: 
;;;     load autoinsert.el
;;;     setq auto-insert-directory to an appropriate value, which
;;;       must end in "/"
