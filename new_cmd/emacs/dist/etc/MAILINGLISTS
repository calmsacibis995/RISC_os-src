    GNU Project electronic mailing lists.  Last Updated 15 Aug 1988

* GNU mailing lists are also distributed as USENET news groups

The mailing lists are gated both ways with the gnu.all newsgroups at
ohio-state.edu.  The one-to-one correspondence is indicated below.  If
you don't know if your site is on USENET, ask your system administrator.
If you are a USENET site and don't get the gnu.all newsgroups, please
ask your USENET administrator to get them.  If he has your feeds ask
their feeds, you should win.  And everyone else wins: newsgroups make
better use of the limited bandwidth of the computer networks and your
home machine than mailing list traffic; and staying off the mailing
lists make better use of the people who maintain the lists and the
machines that the GNU people working with rms use (i.e. we have more
time to produce code!!).  Thanx.


* Getting the mailing lists directly

If several users at your site or local network would like to read a list
and you aren't a USENET site, Project GNU would prefer if you would set
up one address that redistributes locally.  This reduces overhead on our
machine, your gateway machine, and the network(s) used to transport the
mail from us to you.


* How to subscribe and reporting bugs in the mailing lists

Send messages ABOUT these lists, such as reports of mail problems, or
requests to be added or removed, to info-gnu-emacs-request (or
info-gnu-request, bug-gdb-request, etc.), NOT to info-gnu-emacs (or
info-gnu, etc.).  These <LIST_NAME>-request addresses go only to the
people who can do something about your requests or problems, and thus
avoids disturbing everyone else.

All GNU mailing lists are unmoderated, mail reflectors, except info-gnu.
They are very large lists, please don't send them anything that is not
seriously important to many people.

All addresses below are in internet format.  Consult the mail guru for
your computer to figure out address syntaxes from other networks.  From
UUCP machines:
	..!ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!ADDRESS
	..!mit-eddie!mit-prep!ADDRESS


* Specific Requests for Information to: gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

Specific requests for information about obtaining GNU software, or GNU
activities in Cambridge and elsewhere can be directed to:
gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu


* General Information about info-* lists

Most of the time, when you reply to a message sent to an info-* list,
the reply should not go to the info-* list.  But most mailer reading
programs supply all the recipients of the original as recipients of the
reply, by default.  Make a point of deleting the info-* address from the
list when it does not belong.  This prevents bothering all readers of a
list, and reduces network congestion.


* General Information about bug-* lists and reporting program bugs

If you think something is a bug in a program, it might be one; or, it
might be a misunderstanding or even a feature.  Before beginning to
report bugs, please read the section ``Reporting Emacs Bugs'' toward the
end of the GNU Emacs reference manual (or GEM's built-in Info system)
for a discussion of how and when to send in bug reports.  Always include
the version number of the program, as well as the operating system and
machine the program was ran on.  A debugger backtrace of any core dump,
can also be useful.  Be careful to separate out hypothesis from fact!
For GNU Emacs bugs, type "M-x emacs-version"!

Do not expect an answer for a bug report, except sometimes in the form
of a fix for the bug in the next release.  Reporting a bug is done to
get the bug fixed for everyone.  Likewise, we maintainers fix bugs in
order to help the entire community.  We see no such duty to aid
individuals one at a time, such as by sending them individual messages,
and have no time to do this since we are busy doing things for the
entire community.  If you want help for yourself in particular, you may
have to hire someone.  The GNU project maintains a list of people
providing such services.  It is distributed with GNU Emacs in file
../etc/SERVICE, and can be requested from gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Anything addressed to the implementors and maintainers of a GNU program
via a bug-* list, should NOT be sent to the corresponding info-* list.
Bug reports reach the GNU maintainers quickest when they are sent to the
bug-* mailing list submittal address.  Bug reports sent to the gnu.*.bug
newsgroups can be delayed several days.  Bug reports sent to the comp.*
never make it to GNU maintainers - mail them directly!


* info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to info-gnu
** USENET newsgroup: gnu.announce
** List submittal address: info-gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes progress reports on the GNU Project, and asks
people for various kinds of help.  It is NOT for general discussion.

The list is filtered to remove items meant for info-gnu-request, that
can be answered by the moderator without bothering the list, or should
have been sent to another list.


* bug-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to bug-gnu-emacs
** USENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs.bug
** Gnu Emacs bug reports to: bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list distributes bug reports, fixes for bugs, and suggestions for
improvements in GNU Emacs to the active maintainers of GNU Emacs.  It is
the place to report GNU Emacs bugs by all users of GNU Emacs.

Subscribers to bug-gnu-emacs automatically receive all info-gnu-emacs
messages.


* info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to info-gnu-emacs
** USENET newsgroup: gnu.emacs
** submittal address: info-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

This list covers general questions and announcements about GNU Emacs.
Since it is a very large list, send it only those items that are
seriously important to many people.  It is also gated one way to
USENET's newsgroup comp.emacs (once known as net.emacs).  Do not report
GNU Emacs bugs to comp.emacs, instead mail them to
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Users at non-USENET sites may receive
articles from comp.emacs by making their request to:
unix-emacs-request@bbncc5.arpa.

This list distributes bug reports, fixes for bugs, and suggestions for
improvements in the GNU C Compiler to its active developers.  It is the
place to report GCC bugs by all testers of GCC.  The GNU C Compiler
still has bugs in it, and is not quite ready for everyday use.

Always report the version number of gcc, as well as the operating system
and hardware.

Subscribers to bug-gcc automatically receive all info-gcc messages.


* info-gcc-request@prep.ai.mit.edu to subscribe to info-gcc

G++ uses the GNU C-Compiler back end.  Active developers may wish to
subscribe to bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu as well.

GDB+ uses much code from GDB.  Active developers may wish to subscribe
