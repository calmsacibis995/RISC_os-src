This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.
Last updated 31 August 1988

Systems:
  For each type of system, the name of the appropriate s- header file
  is given.

Berkeley 4.1 (s-bsd4-1.h)

  Works on vaxes.

Berkeley 4.2 (s-bsd4-2.h)

  Works on several machines.

Berkeley 4.3 (s-bsd4-3.h)

  Works, on Vaxes at least.

System V rel 0 (s-usg5-0.h)

  Works, on Vaxes and 3bxxx's.
  There are some problems in 18.37 due to shortnames/cccp problems:
  use the emacs 17 cpp if you have it.

System V rel 2 (s-usg5-2.h)

  Works on various machines.
  On some (maybe all) machines the library -lPW exists and contains
  a version of `alloca'.  On these machines, to use it, put
     #define HAVE_ALLOCA
     #define LIB_STANDARD -lPW -lc
  in the m-...h file for the machine.

  If you find that the character Meta-DEL makes Emacs crash,
  find where function init_sys_modes in sysdep.c sets sg.c_cc[VQUIT]
  and make it store 7 there.  I have as yet no evidence of whether
  this problem, known in HP-UX, exists in other system V versions.

System V rel 2.2 (s-usg5-2-2.h)

  In 5.2.2 AT&T undid, incompatibly, their previous incompatible
  change to the way the nlist library is called.  A different s- file
  is used to enable the other interface.

  They call themselves the right choice--can't they choose?

  Emacs version 18 unexec is currently not working properly
  on 5.2.2.  Nobody knows why yet.  A workaround is to define
  NO_REMAP.  It is not yet known whether this applies to all
  machines running 5.2.2.

System V rel 3 (s-usg5-3.h)

  Some versions of this system support ptys and BSD-style sockets.
  On such systems, you should define HAVE_PTYS and HAVE_SOCKETS in config.h.

Ultrix

  This is DEC's name for Berkeley 4.2.

Uniplus 5.2 (s-unipl5-2.h)

  Works, on Dual machines at least.

VMS (s-vms.h)

  Works except for certain features (directory listing, dired,
  sending and receiving mail) that use synchronous subprocesses.
  We need people to write alternative implementations of these
  facilities.

  Note that Emacs for VMS is usually distributed in a special
  VMS distribution.  See the file ../VMSINSTALL for info on moving
  Unix distributions to VMS, and other VMS-related topics.

Xenix

  Should work in 18.50, but you will need to edit the files
  etc/Makefile and src/ymakefile
  (see the comments that mention "Xenix" for what to change.)
  Compiling Emacs with -O is said not to work.

  If you want Emacs to work with Smail (installed as /usr/bin/smail)
  then add the line   #define SMAIL  to config.h.

  The file etc/XENIX suggests some useful things to do to Xenix
  to make the Emacs meta key work.

Machines:
  For each type of machine, the names of the m- and s- header files
  are given.

Alliant (m-alliant4.h or m-alliant.h or m-alliant1.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  18.52 works on system version 4.  Previous Emacs versions were
  known to work on previous system versions.

  Use m-alliant1.h on version 1 of their operating system
  and use m-alliant.h on version 2 or 3.
  Use m-alliant4.h on version 4.

Altos 3068 (m-altos.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Changes, very minimal, for 18.36 have been merged in 18.38.

Amdahl UTS (m-amdahl.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  Small changes for 18.38 were merged in 18.39.  It is mostly
  working, but at last report a bug sometimes causes Emacs to
  grab very large amounts of memory.  No fix or explanation
  has yet been reported.  It may be possible to find this bug
  if you find which Emacs command it happens within and then
  run that command with a breakpoint set at malloc.

  The 5.2u370 compiler is so brain damaged that it is not
  even worth trying to use it.  Success was obtained with the
  uts native C compiler on uts version 5.2.5.

Apollo running Domain (m-apollo.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  18.52 works, to some extent.
  Code for dumping Emacs has been written, but we cannot
  distribute it yet.
  There are reports of bugs in cc -O on this system.

  In etc/Makefile, don't expect emacsclient and server to
  compile.  You might want to remove them from your makefile.

  Supposedly something in dired.c runs into a compiler bug.
  Paraphrasing the statement should avoid the problem.
  I havenot yet received word as to the exact statement this is.

AT&T 3b2, 3b5, 3b15, 3b20 (m-att3b.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  Emacs will probably not work with certain kernel constants too small. 

  In param.h CDLIMIT should be at least (1L << 12) in order to allow 
  processes to write up to 2 Mbyte files.  If it's too small,
  you can perhaps fix it using the file `ulimit.hack' in this directory.

  Note that for V.3.1 and later releases, this parameter is configurable
  by normal means in /etc/master.d/kernel; examine that file for the
  symbol CDLIMIT or ULIMIT, and raise it by several powers of 2.  Then
  do normal kernel rebuild things via "cd /boot; mkboot -k KERNEL" and so
  forth.  Do not use ulimit.hack if you have V.3.1 or later.

  In seg.h NSEGP and STACKSEG should be at least 16 and 4 respectively
  to allow processes with total size of up to 2Mbytes.
  However, I'm told it is unlikely this would fail to be true.

  The MAXMEM may also prevent Emacs from running.  The file
  3B-MAXMEM in this directory explains how to increase MAXMEM.

AT&T 7300 or 3b1 (m-7300.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  18.52 seems to work.  If you have strange troubles with dumping Emacs,
  delete the last few lines from m-7300.h and recompile.  These lines
  are supposed to produce a sharable executable.

  m-7300.h defines SHORTNAMES because operating system versions
  older than 3.5 did not support long symbol names.  Version 3.5 does
  support them, so you can remove the #define SHORTNAMES in that version.

CCI 5/32, 6/32

  See "Tahoe".

Celerity (m-celerity.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Version 18.49 works.

Convex (m-convex.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Changes that should work merged in 18.50.

  18.51 should fix the problems in dumping on operating system version 6.1.

Cydra 5 (m-cydra5.h; s-usg5-3.h)

  18.51 worked in one version of their operating system but stopped
  working in a newer version.  This has not been fixed.

Dual running System V (m-dual.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  As of 17.46, this works except for a few changes
  needed in unexec.c.

Dual running Uniplus (m-dual.h; s-unipl5-2.h)

  Works, as of 17.51.

Elxsi 6400 (m-elxsi; s-usg5-2.h)

  18.36 required one small change that's installed in 18.38.

  m-elxsi.h currenty specifies CANNOT_DUMP.
  The Elxsi can in principle dump, but the necessary changes to
  unexec, which involve byte-swapping, were too ugly to install.
  If someone submits simple code that supports dumping on the Elxsi,
  it can be installed and CANNOT_DUMP can be turned off.

Encore machine (m-ns16000.h; s-umax.h)

  This machine bizarrely uses 4.2BSD modified to use the COFF format
  for object files.  Works (as of 18.40).  For the APC processor you
  must enable two lines at the end of s-umax.h, which are commented
  out in the file as distributed.

  WARNING: If you compile Emacs with the "-O" compiler switch, you
  must also use the "-q enter_exits" switch so that all functions have
  stack frames.  Otherwise routines that call `alloca' all lose.

GEC 93 (m-gec93.h; s-usg5-2.h?)

  Changes are partially merged in version 18, but
  certainly require more work.

Gould (m-gould.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  18.36 worked on versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the operating system.

  On UTX/32 2.0, use s-bsd4-3.h.

  On UTX/32 1.2 and UTX/32S 1.0, use s-bsd4-2.h and note that compiling 
  etc/sorted-doc tickles a compiler bug:  remove the -g flag to cc in the 
  makefile.

  UTX/32 1.3 has a bug in the bcopy library routine.  Fix it by 
  #undef BSTRING in m-gould.h.

HP 9000 series 200 or 300 (m-hp9000s300.h; s-hpux.h)

  Version 18 works.
  These machines are 68000-series CPUs running HP-UX,
  a derivative of sysV with some BSD features.

  Series 200 runs Emacs only if it has the "HP-UX upgrade".

  The series 500 has a seriously incompatible memory architecture
  which relocates data in memory during execution of a program,
  and support for it would be difficult to implement.

  Note that HP has used two incompatible assembler syntaxes,
  and has recently changed the format of C function frames.
  src/crt0.c and src/alloca.s have been conditionalised for the new
  assembler and new function-entry sequence.  You may need to define
  OLD_HP_ASSEMBLER if you are using an older hpux version.  If you
  have an official (bought from HP) series 300 machine you have
  the new assembler.  Kernels that are 5.+ or later have new
  assembler.  A Series 200 that has been upgraded to a 68010
  processor and a 5.+ kernel has the new compiler.

  Define C_SWITCH_MACHINE to be +X to make a version of Emacs that
  runs on both 68010 and 68020 based hp-ux's.

  Define HPUX_68010 if you are using the new assembler, for
  a system that has a 68010 without a 68881.  This is to say,
  a s200 (upgraded) or s310.

  Define the symbol HPUX_NET if you have the optional network features
  that include the `netunam' system call.  This is refered to as
  Network Services (NS/9000) in HP literature.

HP 9000 series 800 (Spectrum) (m-hp9000s800.h; s-hpux.h)

  These files support HP's Precision Architecture machines
  running HP-UX.  It has been moderately tested on the Series
  840.

High Level Hardware Orion (m-orion.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  This is the original microprogrammed hardware.
  m- file ought to work.

High Level Hardware Orion 1/05 (m-orion105.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Changes merged in 18.52.  This is the one with the Clipper cpu.

  C compiler has a bug; it loops compiling eval.c.
  Compile it by hand without optimization.

IBM RT/PC (m-ibmrt.h or m-ibmrt-aix.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-usg5-2-2.h)

  18.52 works on both operating systems.
  Use s-bsd-4-2.h for the 4.2-like system and s-usg5-2-2.h for AIX.

  On AIX, the file /usr/lib/samples/hft/hftctl.c must be compiled into
  hftctl.o, with this result left in the src directory (hftctl.c is
  part of the standard AIX distribution).

Integrated Solutions `Optimum V' (m-isi-ov.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  18.52 said to work on some sort of ISI machine.
  Version 18.45 worked (running on a Optimum V (VME bus, 68020)
  BSD 4.2 (3.05e) system).  18.42 is reported to work on
  a Qbus 68010 system.  Has not been tried on `WorkStation' `Cluster
  Compute Node' `Cluster WorkStation' or `Server Node'  (Love the
  StudLYCaps) 

  Compilation with -O is rumored to break something.

  On recent system versions, you may need to undefine the macro UMAX
  in etc/loadst.c and src/getpagesize.h.  They stupidly defined this
  in a system header file, which confuses Emacs (which thinks that UMAX
  indicates the Umax operating system).

Intel 80386 (m-intel386.h; s-bsd4-2.h, s-usg5-2-2.h, s-usg5-3.h or s-xenix.h)

  Changes merged in 18.50 for all three operating systems.
  If you are using Xenix, see notes above under Xenix.
  Note one version of system V.3 lacks the pty and socket support
  that the V.3 normally (I am told) has; in this case, you should
  #undef HAVE_PTYS and HAVE_SOCKETS in config.h.

Iris 2500 (m-irist.h; s-iris3-5.h or s-iris3-6.h)

  Version 18 said to work; use s-irist3-5.h for system version 2.5
  and s-iris3-6.h for system version 3.6.

Iris 2500 Turbo (m-irist.h; s-iris3-5.h or s-iris3-6.h)

  18.49 works.  Use s-iris3-6.h for system versions 3.6 and up.
  Note that the 3030 is the same machine as this.

Iris 4D (m-iris4d.h; s-iris3-6.h)

  Changes for 18.49 are merged in 18.50.  18.52 seems to work.

  Note that the compilation of etc/loadst.c requires the option -lmld.

Macintosh

  We are boycotting Apple because of Apple's efforts to take away
  our freedom to write free software compatible with hoarded software.
  See the file APPLE in this directory for more information.

Masscomp (m-masscomp.h; s-rtu.h)

  18.36 worked on a 5500DP running RTU v3.1a and compiler version 3.2
  with minor fixes that are included in 18.37.  However, bizarre behavior
  was reported for 18.36 on a Masscomp (model and version unknown but probably
  a 68020 system).  The report sounds like a compiler bug.

  A compiler bug affecting statements like 
    unsigned char k; unsigned char *p;... x = p[k];
  has been reported for "C version 1.2 under RTU 3.1".  We do not wish
  to take the time to install the numerous workarounds required to
  compensate for this bug; go complain to Masscomp.

  For RTU version 3.1, define FIRST_PTY_LETTER to be 'p' in s-rtu.h
  (or #undef and redefine it in config.h) so that ptys will be used.

  GNU Emacs is said to have no chance of compiling on RTU versions
  prior to v3.0.

Megatest (m-mega68.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 15 worked; do not have any reports about Emacs 16 or 17
  but any new bugs are probably not difficult.

Mips (m-mips.h; s-usg5-2.h?)

  Changes merged in 18.39.

NCR Tower 32 (m-tower32.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Nixdorf Targon 31 (m-targon31.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  m- file for version 17 is included in 18
  but whether it works is not known.
  src/unexec.c bombs if compiled with -O.
  Note that the "Targon 35" is really a Pyramid.

Nu (TI or LMI) (m-nu.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Version 18 is believed to work.

Plexus (m-plexus.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Pyramid (m-pyramid.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  In Pyramid system 2.5 there has been a compiler bug making
  Emacs crash just after screen-splitting with Qnil containing 0.
  A compiler that fixes this is Pyramid customer number 8494,
  internal number 1923.

  Some versions of the pyramid compiler get fatal
  errors when the -gx compiler switch is used; if this
  happens to you, change src/m-pyramid.h to define
  C_DEBUG_SWITCH with an empty definition.

  Some old system versions may require you to define PYRAMID_OLD
  in when alloca.s is preprocessed, in order to define _longjmp and _setjmp.

Sequent Balance (m-sequent.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 18.51 should work on system version 3.0.  18.52 is said to work.
  Delete some lines at the end of m-sequent.h for earlier system versions.

SONY News-800 (m-news800.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  18.52 should work.

Stride (m-stride.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works (most recent news for 18.30) on their release 2.0.
  For release 2.2, see the end of m-stride.h.
  It may be possible to run on their V.1 system but changes
  in the s- file would be needed.

Sun 1, 2 and 3 (m-sun1.h, m-sun2.h, m-sun3.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-sunos4.h)

  There are three m- files for different versions of SunOS.
  All are derived from Berkeley 4.2.  Emacs 17 has run on all of them.
  Whether you should use m-sun1.h, m-sun2.h or m-sun3.h depends
  on the VERSION OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM you have.
  You will need to use m-sun3.h on Sun 2's running SunOS release 3.

  For SunOS release 4 on a Sun 3, use m-sun3.h and s-sunos4.h.
  See the file etc/SUNBUG for how to solve problems caused by bugs in
  the "export" version of SunOS 4.

  If you want to use SunWindows, define HAVE_SUN_WINDOWS
  in config.h to enable a special interface called `emacstool'.
  The definition must *precede* the #include "m-sun3.h".
  System version 3.2 is required for this facility to work.

  We recommend that you instead use the X window system, which
  has technical advantages, is an industry standard, and is also
  free software.

  Note that Emacs on a Sun is not really as big as it looks.
  As dumped, it includes around 200k of zeros between the
  original text section and the original data section
  (now remapped as part of the text).  These are never
  swapped in.

  To build a single Emacs that will run on Sun 2 and Sun 3
  HARDWARE, just build it on the Sun 2.

Sun 4 (m-sparc.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-sunos4.h)

  Changes merged in 18.50.  Some people say optimizing compilation
  does not work; some say that -O2 (whatever that is) works
  perhaps with a small change.

  Use s-sunos4.h for operating system version 4.
  See the file etc/SUNBUG for how to solve problems caused by bugs in
  the "export" version of SunOS 4.

Sun Roadrunner (m-sun386.h; s-sunos4.h)

  Changes merged in 18.51.

Tahoe (m-tahoe.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  18.52 known to work on some Tahoes, but a compiler bug intervenes
  on others.  Some Emacs versions have worked in Unisys 1r4
  (not in 1r3) and CCI I.21.

  If you have trouble compiling etc/loadst.c, turn off the definition
  of DKSTAT_HEADER_FILE in m-tahoe.h.

Tektronix 16000 box (6130?) (m-16000.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 17.61 worked.

Tektronix 4300 (m-tex4300.h; s-bsd4-3.h)

  Emacs 18.51 should work.

Ustation E30 (SS5E) (m-ustation.h; s-unipl5-2.h).

  Changes merged in 18.52; don't know whether they work.

Vax running Berkeley Unix (m-vax.h; s-bsd4-1.h, s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  Works.  Note that "ultrix" is essentially 4.2; use s-bsd4-2.h.

Vax running System V rel 2 (m-vax.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  18.27 Works.

Vax running System V rel 0 (m-vax.h; s-usg5-0.h)

  Works as of 18.36.

Vax running VMS (m-vax.h; s-vms.h  but on VMS they are m_vax.h and s_vms.h)

  18.36 believed to work.  Addition of features is necessary to make
  this Emacs version more usable.

Whitechapel MG1 (m-mg1.h, s-?)

  May work.  Supposedly no changes were needed except the m- file.
  I do not know what Unix version runs on them.

Wicat (m-wicat.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Changes merged as of 18.6; whether they work is unknown.
  See comments in m-wicat.h for things you should change
  depending on the system and compiler version you have.
