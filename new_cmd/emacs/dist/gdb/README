This is GDB, a source-level debugger intended for GNU,
presently running under un*x.

Before compiling GDB, you must set up links to four files according to
the kind of machine you are running on.  To do this, type `config.gdb
machine', where machine is something like `vax' or `sun2'.  This
creates links named `param.h', `m-init.h', `opcode.h', and `pinsn.c'.
(Note: we lack information on certain machines.)

Also, `Makefile' must be changed to say `OBSTACK = obstack.o' instead
of `OBSTACK=-lobstack' (unless you want to install obstack.o as
/lib/libobstack.a).

Once these files are set up, just `make' will do everything,
producing an executable `gdb' in this directory.

About the machine-dependent files...

m-<machine>.h

This file contains macro definitions that express information
about the machine's registers, stack frame format and instructions.

m-<machine>init.h

This file defines one macro, which says how to round up from the
address of the end of the text of one .o file to the beginning of
the text of the next .o file.

<machine>-opcode.h, <machine>-pinsn.c
These files contain the information necessary to print instructions
for your cpu type.
