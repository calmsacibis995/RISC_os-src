What an amazing coincidence.  I was in Long's Drug Store on El Camino just 
yesterday, shopping the shampoos, and noticed the henna selection.  I think
I've used henna in the past or maybe I've just thought about it.  Anyway, 
maybe I'll go ahead and actually try it this time.  Reddish or blackish --
either one would be interesting.

Bridget-the-Marriage-Buster, eh?  Now, is this from something I told you or
is the rumor back to your area from other means?

You really do need to learn how to read news.  They just started a
mips.gossip.juicy that describes the sex lives of all employees in
detail.

And about your hair, I really do think it would turn out much more
interesting if you peroxided your hair first, *then* used henna.
