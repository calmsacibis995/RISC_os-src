In other words, the stuff in /user/mips43/current can't build with
the broken compilers.

Have you guys run a complete build on UMIPS-V with the 1.21 compilers?
I'll bet there are problems there as well.

It's not at all important for you to fix your stuff now.  I had just
been under the mis-impression that mips43/current was supposed to be
a buildable tree.
No, 
I remember your complaining, I just didn't realize that you'd left
the problem unresolved.
