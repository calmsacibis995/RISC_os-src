The directory 'dist' contains the files to rn, as gotten from the net.
The directory 'mips' contains modifications to the files in dist,  plus
the configuration files necessary to build the binary.

Files modified by mips:

Configure 	- changed to accept 1 argument (bsd43 or sysv) to specify
		  which flavor of rn to configure.
Makefile.SH 	- cleaned up some; change way in which man pages are installed

Configuration files necessary to create and install rn binaries and associated
files:

Pnews.header 	config.h 	makedir 	ng.help 
Rnmail 		filexp 		newsetup 	pager.help 
Pnews 		art.help 	makedepend 	newsnews 	subs.help 
Makefile 	config.sh 	mbox.saver 	norm.saver 

These files contain bogus information regarding hostname, organization, etc.
You will definitely want to run the Configure program to tailor rn for 
your system.  To run configure, do the following:

	touch mips/config.sh 
	make configure
	make 
	make install

This will make a BSD 4.3 flavor rn program.  If you wish to compile rn
as a System V program, do the following:

	cd mips
	./Configure sysv
	cd ..
	make
	make install
