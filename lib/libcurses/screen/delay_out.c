 * this is not a usable substitute.  It causes a pause in the displayed
 * output, for example, for the eye wink in snake.  It is disrecommended
 * for "delay" to be much more than 1/2 second, especially at high
 * baud rates, because of all the characters it will output.  Note
 * that due to system delays, the actual pause could be even more.
