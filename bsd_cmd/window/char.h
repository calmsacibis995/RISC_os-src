 * Macros and things to deal with control characters.

 * Unctrl() is just like the standard function, except we don't want
 * to include curses.
 * Isctrl() returns true for all characters less than space and
 * greater than or equal to delete.
 * Isprt() is tab and all characters not isctrl().  It's used
 * by wwwrite().
 * Isunctrl() includes all characters that should be expanded
 * using unctrl() by wwwrite() if ww_unctrl is set.
