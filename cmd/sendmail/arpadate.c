**  ARPADATE -- Create date in ARPANET format
**
**	Parameters:
**		ud -- unix style date string.  if NULL, one is created.
**
**	Returns:
**		pointer to an ARPANET date field
**
**	Side Effects:
**		none
**
**	WARNING:
**		date is stored in a local buffer -- subsequent
**		calls will overwrite.
**
**	Bugs:
**		Timezone is computed from local time, rather than
**		from whereever (and whenever) the message was sent.
**		To do better is very hard.
**
**		Some sites are now inserting the timezone into the
**		local date.  This routine should figure out what
**		the format is and work appropriately.
