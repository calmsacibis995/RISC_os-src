#help# 
#help#	Restore copies files from tapes made by "backup"
#help#	back onto the file systems.  You can restore individual files or
#help#	directories of files with this procedure.  
#help#	To restore a complete tape, you should
#help#	follow the directions in the System Administrator's Reference
#help#	Manual and use restore.ffs directly.  
#help#	You can restore from both "incremental" and "complete" tapes.
#help#	You can also list the names of files stored on the tape.
#help#	This script uses restore.ffs.  Please refer to the System
#help#	Administrator Reference Manual for more information.
