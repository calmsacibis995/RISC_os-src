#menu# Set up your machine to behave more like a BSD 4.3 system.
#help#     This script sets up several optional features which make
#help#     the behavior more like a BSD 4.3 system.  The following will change:
#help#      *login will issue an initgroups() call which puts the user in
#help#           all of the groups to which he/she belongs
#help#      *login will allow you to login with no home directory, using
#help#           the root (/) as your home
#help#      *login will warn the user if he/she is over the disk quota
#help#      *chown allows only the root to change the file owner
#help#      *chgrp allows only the root to change a file to a group of which the
#help#           user is not a member
#help#      *newly created files will inherit the group of the directory in
#help#           which they are created
#help#      *child processes of a traced process which exits will receive
#help#           a SIGKILL
#help#      *only the owner or the root may set the file access times via utime
#help#     See the manual pages for login and kopt for more information.
#help#     You will be asked about using sendmail for mail transmission.
#help#     See System Administrator's Guide for more information on sendmail.
#help#     You will be asked about restricting access to ttys like BSD 4.3 does.
#help#     This may require adding the group tty, and may cause other programs
#help#     than those in RISC/os which access the terminal to fail.
