# This file, "exports",  describes the file systems which are being exported
# to nfs clients.  It is created by the system administrator using a text
# editor and processed by the request daemon, mountd(8C), in pre-RISC/OS 4.50
# each time a mount request is received.  With RISC/OS 4.50, this file started
# being read by exportfs(1M).  Every time the file changes, exportfs(1M) must
# be re-run by executing 'exportfs -v -a'.  Executing 'exportfs' only shows the
# current state of the world as believed by the kernel.  See exports(4) for
# more options.
#
# The file system names are left justified and followed by a list of names
# separated by white space.  The names will be looked up in /etc/netgroup
# (may be symbolically linked to /usr/etc/netgroup) and then in /etc/hosts.
# A file system name with no name list following means export to everyone.
# A `#' anywhere in this file indicates a comment extending to the end of
# the line it appears on.  Lines beginning with white space are continuation
# lines.

# EXAMPLE
#    /usr       clients               # export to my clients
#    /usr/local                       # export to the world
#    /usr2      mips sprint quacky    # export to only these machines
